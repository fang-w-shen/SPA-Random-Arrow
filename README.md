# SPA-Random-Arrow
## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/spa/tsa-random && cd $_
touch index.html
touch random.js
touch random.css
```

## Requirements

Your job is to create a web page that, when the user clicks anywhere in the window, randomly determine if an air traveller should go down the left lane or the right lane by displaying an arrow in that direction.

> :pencil2: It does not need to look exactly like this. Display an arrow however you wish.
